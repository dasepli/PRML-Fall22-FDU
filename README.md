## Coursework
### Guidelines
Different from previous years, we will mainly use the [PaddlePaddle AI Studio](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/index) platform this year for our programming exercises. These exercises will teach you to implement the machine learning models you learned step by step and conduct some basic explorations. In addtion to these exercises, several more interesting assignments and a final project will be designed for you to practice using what you have learned to solve some real-world problems. Notice that **we will only grade the assignments and the final project, and leave the exercises just as study materials**. 

These assignments and the final project will be released both on the [e-learning](https://elearning.fudan.edu.cn/) platform and this website. But you have to submit them through the e-learning platform. 

**Late Policy**: Everyone of you have 2 free late days for this semester. You can only use the late days for your assignments but not for the final project report. Once you have exhausted your free late days, we will deduct a late penalty of 25% per additional late day.


### Assignment1: TBD

### Assignment2: TBD

### Assignment3: TBD

### Final Project: TBD
